As PyMC4 builds upon TensorFlow, particularly the TensorFlow Probability and Edward2 modules, its design is heavily influenced by innovations introduced in these packages. In particular, early development was partially derived from a [prototype](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/9c2a4c8bbeddebded2b998027ec7111dcdfd9070/discussion/higher_level_modeling_api_demo.ipynb) written by Josh Safyan.
